This site exhibits my work with Professor Joseph Holler during the fall 2023 semester from Middlebury College GEOG0361, Open GIScience. 


Throughout the semester we explored the realm of open GIScience through a myriad of themes including but not limited to: 
- The meaning of open-source science
- How GIS can be an open science
- What threats exist to open GIScience
- What uncertainty lies in GIScience work
- The importance of reproduction/replication studies in the realm of open science
- How to practice open science principles
- How to execute and expand a reproduction study
The culmination of all of our work navigating through these topics led to the final project of learning how to write [my own reproduction study](https://isaiahbennett2.github.io/reproduction/Green-space-reflection/).   

In this age of newly emerging science and information, Open Science is the future. I am honored to have had the opportunity to delve into the material you will find on this site through one of the few undergraduate Geography programs in the country that offers an entrance into the realm of reproducibility and open GIScience at Middlebury College with Professor Holler. 

Enjoy exploring the blog posts I have written about these discussions, reflections on the four reproduction studies we worked on as a class, and the final reproduction study that I wrote myself!
