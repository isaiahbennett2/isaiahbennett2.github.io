This site represents my work with Professor Joseph Holler during the fall 2023 semester from Middlebury College GEOG0361, Open GIScience. 


Throughout the semester we explored the realm of open GIScience through discussions of what open source science means, how GIS can be an open science, what threats exist to open GIScience, what uncertainty lies in GIScience work, the importance of reproduction/replication studies in the realm of open science, how to practice open science principles, how to execute and expand a reproduction study, and finally how to write your own reproduction study.   

In an age of newly emerging science and information, Open Science is the future. I am honored to have had the opportunity to delve into the material that you will find on this site through one of the few undergraduate Geography programs in the country that offers an entrance into the realm of reproducibility and open GIScienceat Middlebury College with Professor Holler. 

Enjoy exploring the blog posts I have written about these discussions, reflections on the four reproduction studies we worked on as a class, and the final reproduction study that I wrote myself!
