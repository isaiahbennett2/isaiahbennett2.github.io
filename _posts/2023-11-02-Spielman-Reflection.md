Moving on to using spatial python for this reproduction study

Reproduction #3!
This reproduction was a little different than the last two since it was a reproduction of Spielman et al.'s 2020 ["Evaluating social vulnerability indicators: criteria and their application to the Social Vulnerability Index"]( https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z) which is a reproduction of Cutter et al.'s 2003 ["Social vulnerability to environmental hazards"] (https://doi.org/10.1111/1540-6237.8402002). The Cutter at al. piece has been incredibly influential in the field with over 7000 citations. Her study essentially laid the foundation for how to create a social vulnerability model ssetting an example geographers and policy makers alike. Although her model has been used a lot, there is a great lack of external validation which is especially important since the assessment of the social vulnerability of an area can directly influence how resources and support are distributed to such an area in response to a disaster. Spielman et al. 2020 serves to externally validate her popular study and our reproduction of Spielman et al. 2020 improves upon their work.
